Explanation:

Initialization:

If the input nums array is empty, return 0.
max_length: Stores the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence found so far (initialized to 1).
current_length: Keeps track of the length of the current continuous increasing subsequence (initialized to 1).
Iteration:

The code iterates through the nums array starting from the second element (i = 1).
Checking for Increasing Subsequence:

In each iteration, it checks if the current element (nums[i]) is greater than the previous element (nums[i - 1]).
If it is, it means we're continuing the current increasing subsequence, so current_length is incremented.
If it's not, the current increasing subsequence is broken, so current_length is reset to 1 to start counting a new subsequence.
Updating max_length:

In each iteration, max_length is updated to store the maximum value between the current max_length and current_length.
Returning max_length:

After iterating through the entire array, the max_length is returned, which represents the length of the longest continuous increasing subsequence.
Time Complexity:

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. This is because we iterate through the array only once.
