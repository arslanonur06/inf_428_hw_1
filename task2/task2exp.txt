Explanation:

generate_random_data(mean, variance, sample_size): This function generates a list of random threat scores within the range of 0-90, given a mean, variance, and sample size. This is used to simulate different threat scenarios.
calculate_aggregated_threat_score(department_data, importance_weights): This function calculates the aggregated threat score by:
Calculating the mean threat score for each department.
Multiplying the mean score by the department's importance weight.
Summing the weighted scores across all departments.
Normalizing the sum to a 0-90 range based on the total possible weighted score.
Unit Tests:

The TestAggregatedThreatScore class includes several unit tests to verify the calculate_aggregated_threat_score function works correctly in various scenarios:

test_no_threat: Tests the case where all departments have no threat (all scores are 0).
test_uniform_threat: Tests the case where all departments have the same moderate threat level.
test_varying_threat_levels: Tests the scenario where departments have different average threat levels.
test_varying_importance: Tests the case where departments have different importance weights.
test_outliers: Tests the scenario where some departments have outlier users with very high threat scores.
Functional Test:

test_functional_case_1: This is a functional test case designed to simulate a realistic scenario where:
There are no significant outliers in any department.
The average threat scores across departments are relatively similar.
